      <h3>Who was Francisco de Assis França?</h3>
      <p class="bio">Francisco de Assis França, known as Chico Science, were a brasilian musician responsible for
        creating the
        Manguebeat movement in the middle of 1990, the last biggest musical revolution from Brazil. Chico was
        the singer and leader from the band Chico Science & Nação Zumbi, recorded only two albuns: "Da Lama ao
        Caos" and "Afrociberdelia", as he was a victim of car accident in 1997. His both albuns were included in
        100 best albums of Brazilian music by Rolling Stone magazine and his artistic contribution persist and it's been
        unfolding until today.</p>

      <h3>Trajectory</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on <span class="bold">03/13/1966</span> in Olinda, Pernambuco, Brazil</li>
        <li>In <span class="bold">1984</span>, he joined one of the main dancing groups of Recife, <span
            class="bold">Legião Hip-Hop</span>.</li>
        <li>In <span class="bold">1987</span>, he formed his first musical group, called <span class="bold">"Orla
            Orbe"</span>, that used to play black music, but the group dismissed before completing one year.</li>
        <li>After that, he formed the band <span class="bold">"Loustal"</span>, in honor of French comic artist Jacques
          de Loustal, that played a mix of 1960's rock with funk and hip-hop.</li>
        <li>The fusion of brasilian's northeastern rythmics, specially with <span class="bold">Maracatu</span>, began in
          <span class="bold">1991</span>, when he came into contact with the afro block <span class="bold">Lamento Negro</span>,
          from Peixinhos, a suburb of Olinda, which was doing popular education work on the outskirts of greater Recife, and
          brought together folkloric rhythms, such as rural maracatu and côco de roda with samba-reggae.
        </li>
        <li>Com a fusão do Loustal e o Lamento Negro surgiu o grupo <span class="bold">“Chico Science e Lamento Negro”</span>,
          que depois foi batizado com o nome <span class="bold">“Chico Science & Nação Zumbi”</span>. A estreia da banda
          aconteceu em junho de <span class="bold">1991</span>.</li>
        <li>In <span class="bold">1993</span>, a quick tour of <span class="bold">São Paulo</span> and <span
            class="bold">Belo Horizonte</span> caught the attention of the media.</li>
        <li>The first album was released in <span class="bold">1994</span> (Da Lama ao Caos), which featured the songs <span
            class="bold">“A Praieira”</span> and <span class="bold">“A Cidade”</span>, which were part of the soundtrack for the
          soap operas Tropicaliente and Irmãos Coragem, respectively. The album was well received by critics and promoted the
          band nationally.</li>
        <li>The second album, <span class="bold">Afrociberdelia</span>, from <span class="bold">1996</span>, more pop and
          electronic, confirmed the <span class="bold">innovative tendency</span> of Chico Science and Nação Zumbi, who toured
          Europe, where they met <span class="bold">Os Paralamas do Sucesso</span>, and the United States, where they were a
          success with the public and critics and they played together with <span class="bold">Gilberto Gil</span>. Gil
          considered Chico Science (along with the Bahian group Olodum) as <span class="bold">"the most important thing that has
          emerged in Brazilian music in the last twenty years"</span>. The song “Maracatu Atômico”, a song by Jorge Mautner
          and Nelson Jacobina, which was a hit in 1973, performed by Gilberto Gil, became the group's anthem.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">February 2, 1997</span> would go down as the most devastating day in the history of manguebeat.
          At the end of that afternoon, the car driven by Chico Science collided with a pole on the highway between Recife and
          Olinda, taking the life of the singer and composer, on the eve of turning 31 years old. Science was still rescued by a
          police officer who was passing by on a bus and took him to Hospital da Restauração, but he did not resist and arrived
          at the hospital dead. The burial took place on Monday, February 3, 1997, at the Santo Amaro Cemetery, located in
          Recife.</li>
        <li>
          His two albums were included in the list of the <span class="bold">100 best albums of Brazilian</span> music by <span
            class="bold">Rolling Stone</span> magazine, drawn up based on a vote with 60 journalists, producers and scholars of
          Brazilian music: Da Lama ao Caos was in 13th position and Afrociberdelia in 18th. In <span class="bold">October
            2008</span>, Rolling Stone magazine promoted the <span class="bold">List of the One Hundred Greatest Artists of
            Brazilian Music</span>, in which Chico Science occupied 16th place.</li>
        <li>
          Although sad, Chico Science's early death strengthened the Manguebeat Movement. Nação Zumbi released a double
          CD in 1998, with new songs and live versions remixed by DJs. Their version of the song "Maracatu Atômico" was
          the clip that closed the activities of MTV Brasil, by the group Abril, on September 30, 2013.
